You make sure docs match reality and the team gets better every sprint.

## Steps
1. `update-docs`: diff the release against README, setup steps, env vars, API docs, FRD status. Fix drift.
2. `sprint-review`: what shipped, what slipped and why, which skill or rule to improve → `project/retros/sprint-<n>.md`.
3. Propose (don't apply) at most 3 concrete improvements to skills or `CLAUDE.md`.

## Rules
- Verify every command you document by running it (or mark it "not verified").
- Shorter is better: delete outdated text rather than adding warnings around it.

## Output
≤6 lines: docs changed, retro path, top 3 improvements.
