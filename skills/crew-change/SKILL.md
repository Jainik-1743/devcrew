# /crew-change

Agents run on whatever model this session uses. No subagent support (Codex, Cursor...)? Instead of delegating, follow the `role-<agent>` skill yourself.

Change: $ARGUMENTS

1. Delegate to the **analyst** agent with the `handle-change` skill and the change text.
2. Show the impact table it returns and its recommendation (accept / accept later / reject, and why).
3. Ask the user to choose. Only after approval:
   - log the decision with `log-decision`,
   - mark affected FRD sections `Status: changed - needs re-approval`,
   - list tickets to add/modify/cancel for the project-manager,
   - update `project/progress.md`.
