# /crew-start

Agents run on whatever model this session uses. No subagent support (Codex, Cursor...)? Instead of delegating, follow the `role-<agent>` skill yourself.

Requirements: $ARGUMENTS

1. If `project/progress.md` is missing, create the `project/` files (progress, decisions, glossary, shared-questions, assumptions, handoffs/).
   If it exists and Phase is not Discovery, stop and suggest `/crew-next` instead.
2. Save the requirements verbatim to `docs/brief.md` (if a path was given, copy that file).
3. Delegate to the **analyst** agent (big-picture mode) with: `docs/brief.md`. It returns question cards and a draft `docs/frd/00-spec-list.md`.
4. Show the user the question cards (BLOCKER first) using the AskUserQuestion tool when available — one question per card, recommended option first.
   Record answers; unanswered → default, logged in `project/assumptions.md`.
5. Update `project/progress.md`: Phase Discovery → "awaiting spec list approval".
6. End with: the spec list, and "Approve with `/crew-next`, or tell me what to change."
