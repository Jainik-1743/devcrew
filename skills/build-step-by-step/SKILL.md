# Build step by step

1. Write the plan as ≤7 steps in the ticket file under `Plan:` — each step leaves the app working.
2. For each step:
   - change ≤ ~100 lines, touching as few files as possible;
   - run the fast checks for what you touched (related tests + typecheck + lint on changed files);
   - commit with a Conventional Commit message referencing the ticket (`feat(booking): lock slot row PROJ-12`);
   - tick the step.
3. If a step fails twice, stop and re-plan that step smaller; don't pile changes on a red build.
4. Pull/rebase from main before the last step to surface conflicts early.

Keep notes for the reviewer in the ticket (`Notes for review:`) — decisions, trade-offs, known limits.
