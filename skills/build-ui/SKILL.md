# Build UI

> Owner: **developer** agent. Not running as it? Delegate this skill to it (no subagents: follow `role-developer`). Inside it, just do the steps.


Inputs: ticket, approved wireframe, `docs/design/design-system.md`, tokens.

1. Find existing components first (grep the components folder). Reuse > extend > create.
2. Build the screen in the feature folder (`src/features/<feature>/`); shared pieces go to `src/shared/ui/`.
3. Implement all 5 states from the wireframe; wire real loading/error from the API layer.
4. Styling only through tokens / the component library theme. No raw colors or magic spacing.
5. Accessibility as you build: semantic elements, labels, focus management, keyboard paths.
6. Test: component tests for states + one e2e for the main flow (Playwright).
7. Look at it: run the app and check 375px and 1280px, both themes. Fix before `confirm-done`.

## Rules
- Copy text from the FRD/glossary exactly.
- Don't block the UI on missing backend: use a typed mock behind the same interface, and note it in the ticket.
