# /crew-next

Agents run on whatever model this session uses. No subagent support (Codex, Cursor...)? Instead of delegating, follow the `role-<agent>` skill yourself.

User note: $ARGUMENTS

1. If the note approves or answers something, record it first (approval → `project/decisions.md`; answer → the question file + remove from Open questions).
2. Apply the `whats-next` skill (or delegate to the **team-lead** agent) to get: Next / Owner / Brief.
3. If Owner is "you": show what needs approval or an answer, with a recommendation. Stop.
4. Otherwise delegate the Brief to the Owner agent. Pass file paths, not file contents.
5. When it returns, run `track-progress`. Show the user ≤8 lines: what was done, files, what's next.
6. Independent steps (e.g. spec 2 questions while spec 1 is built) may run as parallel agents.
